Lesson 1 in programming a 128K Spectrum with Z88dk SCCZ80


This is Part 1 of programming a 128K Spectrum with Z88dk using the SCCZ80 compiler.

Step by step programming for a 128K Spectrum.  In this lesson we are going to explore how to create 3 seperate programs in each portion of memory, contended (0x5DC0 - 0x7FFF), uncontended low (0x8000 - 0xBFFF) and uncontended high (0xC000 - 0xFFFF).
